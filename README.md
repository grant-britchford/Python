## Description
This week was a learning path for the Python Language. The week took us through cleaning data and the analysis, and the visualization processes
that Python can perform.

## Data

## Steps Taken

### Task 1
- The first task I undertook was to write the FizzBuzz code using the Python language.

### Task 2
- Using a student CSV file, I had to load the raw data and be able to read this using Python.
- I had to show only the first 5 rows of the data.
- Get the information about the data set.
- And finally, to view the summary statistics of the data.

### Task 3
- Using the student data, I had to select just the 'Name' column.
- To get the 'Name' and 'Mark' columns.
- To view the first 3 rows of the data.
- And to select all rows where the 'Class' number was 4.

### Task 4
- Using data manipulation, I then wrote the code to add a new column. This column then showed which students had passed or failed.

### Task 5
- In this step, I used the MatPlotLib function to create a pie chart that showed the percentages of each grade.
